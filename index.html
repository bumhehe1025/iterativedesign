                <p class = "text" >Alongside a small team , I helped design an interactive interface based 
                    on the problem that the emerging startup has. Re-mint was a startup that we worked with,
                    an official secondhand marketplace for fashion brands. We went through the full process of
                     mocking up a solution to the startup’s concept:  (1) sketching ideas of the interface, (2)
                      creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, (3) conducting user testing on a final, 
                      revised prototype, and (4) contacting the start-up. </p>

                <p class =  "text">Re-mint lets fashion brands set up official secondhand marketplaces 
                    so their customers can buy and sell directly with each other. The startup help brands 
                    monetize their resale market. Re-mint offers revenue share on transaction fees and uses 
                    the transaction data to drive new sales. How the interface of the startup will be a space 
                    for all brands, sellers, and customers to interact with one another is a point of difference 
                    that we haven’t seen from other companies and intrigued us to concoct an interface for their particular needs. </p>

                    features displayed due to the larger screen size. Users who are interested in fashion, second-hand clothing,

                    These users would most likely be in their teens and 20s, and be either consumer or buyer users. We expect a lot

                        different favorite brands (hover only for now due to Figma limitations), and then submit to 
                        begin shopping. We then want you to shop specifically for Lululemon clothes and checkout, 
                        and then finally sell your old Zara clothes.  Currently, we are in an interactive mockup stage, and we are 
                        designing in Figma with limited functionality, so please assume that information is pre-filled 
                        for you and that some things are only hoverable (limited amount of clicks per page).
                         However, please attempt to use our website as realistically as possible, 
                         click through the different pages, and think aloud. Thank you!</p>
